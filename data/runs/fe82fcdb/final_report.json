"# ACE Customer Intelligence Report\n\n## Run Metadata\n- **Run ID:** `fe82fcdb`\n- **Generated:** 2025-12-22 14:47:29\n- **Dataset Quality Score:** 1.0\n- **Data Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate)\n\n## Confidence & Governance\n- Insights allowed by contract and validation gate.\n- Confidence reasons:\n  - Target variance insufficient.\n- Allowed sections: clustering, data_overview, eda, insights, quality\n\n## Data Type Identification\n- **Primary Type:** marketing_performance (confidence: exploratory)\n- Primary type inferred from column/value signals (score=2).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> **Fallback Mode Active**\n> Some parts of the engine ran in fallback mode due to missing schema or insufficient feature depth.\n> ACE automatically switched to backup intelligence.\n\n**Domain Context:** unknown\n\n## Executive Summary\nValidation mode: limitations (confidence: exploratory). Certain agents were skipped due to insufficient evidence: fabricator, regression Dataset type: marketing_performance (exploratory confidence). The engine identified 1 behavioral segments.\n\n## Validation & Guardrails\n- **Mode:** limitations\n- **Validation Confidence:** exploratory\n- **Rows:** 100000 | **Columns:** 5\n- **Blocked Agents:** fabricator, regression\n- sample_size: ok (Rows=100000, min_required=50)\n- target_variable: issue (Not found)\n- variance: issue (No target to assess)\n- time_coverage: issue (No time field with coverage)\n- causal_context: issue (No causal design detected; analysis treated as observational.)\n- No suitable target variable detected; regression and strategy generation will be skipped.\n- Time coverage unknown; treat any trend/forecasting as exploratory only.\n- Dataset treated as observational; causal claims are prohibited.\n\n## Limitations & Diagnostics\n- Validation in limitation mode; only diagnostics are shown.\n- Confidence driver: Target variance insufficient.\n\n## Behavioral Clusters\nSuppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n\n## Outcome Modeling\nOutcome modeling suppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n\n## Generated Personas & Strategies\nPersonas and strategies suppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n\n## Anomaly Detection\n**Total Anomalies Detected:** 0\n"
