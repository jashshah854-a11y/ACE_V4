"# ACE Customer Intelligence Report\n\n## Run Metadata\n- **Run ID:** `92c70a02`\n- **Generated:** 2026-01-01 20:46:13\n- **Dataset Quality Score:** N/A\n- **Data Confidence:** 0.1 (low)\n\n## Confidence & Governance\n> [!WARNING]\n> Confidence is essentially zero; all rankings, risk labels, personas, and strategies are suppressed.\n- Confidence reasons:\n  - High null rate in at least one column.\n  - Blocking drift detected.\n- Allowed sections: data_overview, quality\n\n## Data Type Identification\n- **Primary Type:** time_series_trends (confidence: moderate)\n- Primary type inferred from column/value signals (score=6).\n\n**Domain Context:** unknown\n\n## Executive Summary\nValidation mode: limitations (confidence: high). Certain agents were skipped due to insufficient evidence: fabricator, overseer, personas, regression Dataset type: time_series_trends (moderate confidence).\n\n## Validation & Guardrails\n- **Mode:** limitations\n- **Validation Confidence:** high\n- **Rows:** 400 | **Columns:** 7\n- **Blocked Agents:** fabricator, overseer, personas, regression\n- sample_size: ok (Rows=400, min_required=50)\n- target_variable: ok (revenue)\n- variance: ok (usable=165, std=21759.3453 unique=165)\n- time_coverage: ok (399.0 days)\n- causal_context: issue (No causal design detected; analysis treated as observational.)\n- Dataset treated as observational; causal claims are prohibited.\n- Profile/sample drift at block level; insights disabled.\n\n## Limitations & Diagnostics\n- Insights withheld: data confidence below cutoff.\n- Validation in limitation mode; only diagnostics are shown.\n- Task contract or validation forbids insights.\n- Confidence driver: High null rate in at least one column.\n- Confidence driver: Blocking drift detected.\n\n## Behavioral Clusters\nSuppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n\n## Outcome Modeling\nOutcome modeling suppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n\n## Generated Personas & Strategies\nPersonas and strategies suppressed due to confidence/contract/validation gates.\n"
